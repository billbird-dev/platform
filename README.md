## BillBird platform v2

### What is this

Billbird is a 360 degree business management platform with following features

- Billing
- Estimate
- Inventory
- Customers
- Suppliers
- Ledger
- Parent-child business chain support

Billbird was not launched in the market. Me and @SoumyaRanjanNaik had many other things to look after, so we had very little amount of time to maintain and launch this. We hope that somebody will use this and build something that will make an impact.
